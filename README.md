Tourista : Tourista Github Repository for Bangkit Academy 2023 Capstone Project from 3 learning path <br>
Machine Learning, Mobile Development, Clour Computing from team C23-PR509.

# About The Project
Tourism is one of the activities carried out by the community after the Covid-19 pandemic began to subside. Based on data from Google, in 2022, people's interest in traveling both domestically and internationally will increase. This was also followed by a trend on social media that made people experience FOMO. As a result, when people go on trips, several problems arise, including selecting tourist destinations that do not meet expectations, over-tourism, and traffic jams. The increase in public interest in traveling is not in line with the increase in income of creative economy entrepreneurs around tourist attractions. One of the reasons is because tourists cannot reach their promotional efforts. From these problems, we have an idea to help the community by providing information on tourist attractions according to their preferences while at the same time helping to promote the businesses of creative economy actors around tourist attractions.
